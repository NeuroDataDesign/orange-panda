##Relevance to Our Research

#EEG - Measures voltage fluctuations

Raw values differ from subject to subject.
--> Interpret general pattern / time-frequency characteristics

#Brain Rhythms
Delta / Theta / Alpha / Beta / Lower Gamma / Upper Gamma / Subdelta

#Baseline normalization
Remove constantly present artifacts

#Time Frequency Results
-Power (energy at each freq. band) vs. Frequency
-Plot one frequency band over time-frequency
-One time-frequency point over electrodes on a topographical plot
-Frequency vs. Time
-Activity of electrode over time

#Vertical Stripes
-Ripple artifact from lack of filters

#Event Markers
-Used to lock EEG data

#Intera/Inter - Trial Timing
-Brain activity must subside between trials

#Preprocessing
-Eyetracking
--Lets you remove trials where subjects looked away from the fixation spot
--Remove oculomotor artifacts from EEG data
--Changes in pupil dilation

#What is Preprocessing?
-Organize data / extract epochs from continuous data
-Remove bad or artifact ridden data
-Temporal filters / Spatial Transformations

#Epochs
-Pros and cons to large epochs
-Generally 1500ms for 2Hz activity
