### Summary:
Basically, EEG has strong temporal data, as it monitors electrical activity. However, as it is an on-scalp electrode, it lacks spatially. fMRI is the inverse of this, as it receives strong data across the brain, but it monitors blood flow and thus captures data at a much slower rate. This paper looks at the growing trend and idea of combining the two's data types to get the advantages of both. EEG-informed fMRI is a general fMRI model convoluted based on the EEG signals and gets further modeled onto a brain map. In contrast, fMRI-informed EEG relies on an initially estimated spatial map that is then influenced by the scalp measurments made by the EEG. If focusing on the scalp activity, fMRI-informed EEG is the way to go, but in the case of a more function-focused and throughout brain focused study, EEG-informed fMRI is the move. Also interesting is that the data can be taken at separate times and then combined later.

Additionally, ICA will be able to find specific functions that are found by data from both sets.

### Scope of BCI:
We can combine different data sets (potentially) if we can find direct algorithms that can handle datasets from different experiments. This adds to the amount of data we can use to train our program and adds a level of potential novelty with using old, potentially untapped and uncombined, data.
