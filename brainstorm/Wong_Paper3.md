## [Paper 2: Brain-Computer Interface Games and an Opinion Survey from Researchers, Developers, and Users]

### Summary:
This is a market research on the feasibility of BCI games and searching for the opinions of all parties involved in making and playing a video game. It also accounts for their opinions on other BCI applications. A few types of existing BCI games are also listed right now. These include active, reactive, and passive BCI usage. Active BCI uses the brain for some control such as a pinball game. Reactive BCI reacts immediately to prevent failure such as flappy bird. Passive BCI checks the mood of the user. 

### Data and Method:
A total of 294 participants were part of the survey. They have varying experiences in the gaming industry. The results show that across all types of parties, the consensus remains that other BCI industries will have a preference or bigger influence than BCI gaming. (User: 90% vs 73%, Developer: 94% vs 84%, Researcher: 85% vs 65%). 

The participants do think that BCI gaming seems feasible and does have a relatively well applicability. However, applicabilities are thought to be better spent in other places such as prosthesis and rehabilitation. Motor imagery is also the most interested in application out of all the big paradigms of BCI.

### Scope of BCI:
Reading this research on what the market wants allows us to better pinpoint our project. It helps us to realize that the scope of BCI is so wide but there are very specific applications the market wants from us right now. Gaming is not necessarily a priority.
