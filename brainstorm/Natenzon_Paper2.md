### Summary:
Study investigated the Emotiv EPOC's accuracy in detecting the emotions (afffective computing):
boredon, frustration, meditation, excitement
and engagement, to integrate with an intelligent tutoring system for students.
An existing system was created to accomplish this task using the Emotiv Epoc, skin conductance
MIT mind reader system, and pressure sensors. However, it could only analyse the data after the 
participant finished using the system.

It was concluded through three different experiments that the Epoc cound not accurately determine
a user's emotional state. However, it is important to note that the test group of users was very
small, and no training data or machine learning algorithm seemed to have been used.
### Scope of BCI:
This study mentions three very important issues with EEG headsets: channels disconnecting, noise being 
collected, and signals being lost. These issues accunt for some of the discrepencies present 
in the system. However, this article also demonstrates the importance of using a machine learning 
algorithm to better identify a users' emotional state, as the user spends more time on the headset.
Ex. When a user sees a pop-up, and then proceeds to immediately close it (rather than spend time to read it),
it can be concluded that the brain signal recorded at the time of the popup was one relating to irritation or 
frustration.
