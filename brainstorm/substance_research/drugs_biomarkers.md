## Alcohol: 

- [Determination of ethyl glucuronide in nails by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as a potential new biomarker for chronic alcohol abuse and binge drinking behavior (2011):](http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d682047c-c3c6-42ad-a556-1e882fd587a0%40sessionmgr4002&vid=1&hid=4108) Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is used as a biomarker from human nails via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method to detect chronic alcohol abuse. EtG can be measured in various body fluids. Test is simple and only need finger nails cut by scissors. The results show that once a patient passed the consumption of 10 g/day (recall that one standard drink of alcohol is approximately 14 g of ethanol), EtG concentration can be measured and quantified in their nails. 
    Question:
    Getting someone to cut their nails and send it to a lab is easy. Can we do this liquid chromatography/mass spectrosocopy technique in a portable manner in anyway?

## Tobacco:

 - [Hair as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke - there's a difference in metabolism between smokers and non-smokers (2002):](http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/3/176.full.pdf+html) Nicotine can be converted into cotinine which is found in significantly higher amount in a smoker's hair. (for mothers: >6 mg for active smokers vs 1-2 mg for passive smokers, vs almost none for non-smokers, for neonates: ~3 mg for active smokers vs ~1 mg for passive smokers vs almost none for non-smokers)Easy to track. However might just be second-hand smoking. 

## Cocaine:

 - [Norcocaine in human hair as a biomarker of heavy cocaine use in a high risk population (2014):](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073814002308) Norcocaine (NCOC) can be used as a biomarker for frequent users of cocaine. This substance has a preferred advantage over other metabolites of cocaine because norcocaine can only be made from cocaine. Therefore, trace amounts of it will not be coming from external use. However, only little amounts can be found and it is only found in consistently drug abusing users (85-90th percentile). Not exactly sure how useful this information would be. There's also no significant difference on race, gender, psychiatric disorder, or psychotropic medication in the level of serum BDNF levels. 

 - [Brain-derived neurotrophic factor serum levels in cocaine-dependent patients during early abstinence (2013):](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X12002490) BDNF is an important modifier related to the expression of serotonin and dopamine. Early abstinent cocaine-dependent patients had their BDNF measured. 23 patients go through a two week detoxification program and had their BDNF measured at the beginning and at the end of the program. There's another control group mesured, and it has around a 46 ng/mL level of BDNF Serum while pateitns pre had 23. Then by the end of the two weeks, the patients had a slight increase in BDNF level. BDNF level might be correlated to craving levels. 
  
 - [Hair Cortisol and Stressful Life Events Retrospective Assessment in Crack Cocaine Users(2012):](http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=599aa223-3014-4f80-b3e2-b4dcea58c6ad%40sessionmgr102&vid=1&hid=121) Individuals with cocaine dependence have around twice as much daily stressors as healthy controls.  Crack cocaine addicts were locked to stay clean for three weeks. Their cortisol levels were measured 90, 60, and 30 days prior to admission. It increased from ~16 pg/mg to 24 ~pg/mg. However this research isn't indicative of cortisol's effectiveness as a biomarker because it is comparing the number of stressful life events that these crack cocaine users have to their cortisol level rather than having a healthy control group.

 ## More on BDNF:

 - [Is serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor related to craving for or use of alcohol, cocaine, or methamphetamine? (2011):](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.349.8454&rep=rep1&type=pdf) BDNF can be measured using enzyme linked immunoassay. Addiction can have a long term effect on the neurotransmission of drug patients. The BDNF measurements were done on patients who had around 25 days of abstinent and some had up to 250 days. The result is the amount of Serum BDNF decreases as the number of days abstaining from alcohol, cocaine, psychostimulant, or methamphetamine increases.
