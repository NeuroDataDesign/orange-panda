# BCI Treatment for PTSD

 - [Wearable Patch Used for TNS (Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation):](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ner.12399/full) not exactly a BCI, but it's a treatment based on sending a signal via a wearable into someone's brain (via trigeminal nerve) to modify activity of regions associated with PTSD (this is a growing treatment for depression + epilepsy). They saw pretty decent results, but really only proved safety of treatment, as small population and potential placebo effects may ruin results. They will be doing a bigger experiment with more veterans, but this will likely take 2 or 3 years.
