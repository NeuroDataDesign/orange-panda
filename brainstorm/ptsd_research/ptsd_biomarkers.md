# Biomarkers in PTSD

 - Wearable Sensor Platform and Mobile Application for Use in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Drug Addiction and PTSD (paper can be found in ptsd_research folder): Looks at PTSD suffering veterans with drug addiction issues. **Uses ankle neoprene bands to monitor electrodermal signals, 3-axis motion, and temperature (indicates arousal). Also uses ECG to measure valence via heart rate variability.** Research looked promising, not too many concrete results at time. Can't find further results.

 - [Ginger.io:](https://ginger.io/evidence/) a bit of both treatment and biomarker, while not measuring concrete biomarkers, it uses surveys and exercises to monitor current mood health, as well as connects users to psychiatrists via facetime. Surveys and other already used forms of qualitatively looking at mood may be something to look at (also their treatment and communication with psychiatrist format is very smart).



### Slightly Relevant:

 - [Beyond Fun: The Vital Future of Wearables:](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3042674/the-vital-if-unfun-future-of-wearables) discusses how the future of wearables lies in practical application of them to relevant medical applications. Reasons:
    - Automated health coordination (and automatically shared + standardized collection of data) 
    - Increased access to care (affordability, ease of use)
    - Automated self-exams, remotely activated implants
    - **PTSD:** Wearables allow for remote monitoring, 21% of 5.2 million PTSD Americans receive "minimally adequate treatment."
    - [Neumitra:](https://neumitra.com/research) bio-device that monitors stress via electrodermal signals. Will soon open source data.
