# Biomarkers in PTSD

### Papers:

 - Wearable Sensor Platform and Mobile Application for Use in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Drug Addiction and PTSD (paper can be found in ptsd\_research folder): Looks at PTSD suffering veterans with drug addiction issues. **Uses ankle neoprene bands to monitor electrodermal signals, 3-axis motion, and temperature (indicates arousal). Also uses ECG to measure valence via heart rate variability.** Research looked promising, not too many concrete results at time. Can't find further results.

 - [Ginger.io:](https://ginger.io/evidence/) a bit of both treatment and biomarker, while not measuring concrete biomarkers, it uses surveys and exercises to monitor current mood health, as well as connects users to psychiatrists via facetime. Surveys and other already used forms of qualitatively looking at mood may be something to look at (also their treatment and communication with psychiatrist format is very smart).

 - Wearable Sensors Can Assist in PTSD Diagnosis (paper found in ptsd\_research folder): Their research is phenomenal, with 58 subjects, monitoring of skin conductance on fingers, heart rate (resting and changing with stimulus), and a variety of other (respiratory rate, finger pulse amplitude. Focusing on conductance and heart rate, found higher heart rates from PTSD patients and increased conductance after given 3D video stimulus of war zones. Also made a machine learning algorithm that could distinctly classify people who experienced trauma but had no PTSD, people with PTSD, and people without it.
    - Used [BIOPAC](https://www.biopac.com/) for sensors
    - Sources 5, 17, and 19 are Vietnam, WW II, and Korean War documentations of soldiers with PTSD and relevant cardio/physio measurements

 - [Biomarkers in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Overview and Implications for Future Research(2013):](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774961/) extensive coverage of different biomarkers that represent cause of the disease, whether the disease is there, and to monitor progress of treatment. Some found biomarkers involve SNPs on the FKBP5 gene, and that specific hormone releases and childhood trauma can induce changes in the SNPs and make the person more susceptible to PTSD. As far as outer-measurable biomarkers go, other than cardio, there was brain imaging (such as amygdala activity, hippocampus size (which doesn't have a proven relation), etc.). There were many other biomarkers found, but not sure how much of this is measurable via wearables. It also says no other biomarkers have been distinctively found that are external measures of ptsd, so that may be a difficulty.

 - [Biomarkers of PTSD: military applications and considerations (2014):](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138702/) "Extant biological research on PTSD suggests that information obtained from any given system or dimension of data alone may yield a biomarker relating to some aspect of PTSD, but that a comprehensive understanding of this condition may only be obtained from evaluating entire biological networks that in turn increase or decrease the risk of illness or affect illness severity."
    - No established biomarkers of PTSD
    - Likely no biomarker affects distinct part of brain, rather, PTSD is a complex disease with potential issues accross different parts of brain with various potential factors
    - Applications of biomarker: 
        - Risk evaluation
        - Validating trauma exposure
        - Predicting + monitoring recovery
        - Subtyping PTSD
    - Challenges in identifying biomarker:
        - Various influences on many levels (biological, environmental, psycho, social)
        - Markers may not be unique to PTSD
        - Markers are probablistic, not definitive
    - Clinical, ethical, social, legal considerations. Eg:
        - Public lack of knowledge may add stigma for employers, people, etc. How much should people know, and how will we educate them?
        - To what extent should businesses with trauma-potential environments screen potential PTSD victims?
        - What if someone still feels PTSD, but biomarkers have gone down?

 - Diagnostic Biomarkers for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Promising Horizons from Translational Neuroscience Research (located in folder): gives a span of different biomarkers that have been related to PTSD. I'm not including a huge list here because there are so many and they traverse so many systems (endocrinal, lymph, neurological, etc.). However, they give nice summaries of the readings in tables accross the paper. They acknowledge many of these relationships need more defining and also that PTSD is a very complex disease that sees contributors accross the spectrum, and accurate use and testing for PTSD will involve using multiple of these factors. Also, many of these factors may be more related to stress-related disorders and stress-inducing activity. Also, again skin conductance and heart rate and activity, especially with correct stimulus.

 - [Biomarkers for combat-related PTSD: focus on molecular networks from high-dimensional data:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138711/) rather than giving concrete data, points out that PTSD is an emergent property of a complex set of biological functions. Offers a method of trying to investigate high-dimensions of data to account for multiple different types of data (genomic, mRNA, etc.). Points out relevant data will need to be collected via experiments that focus on a large set of potential factors in PTSD patients rather than isolating a few and seeing how they interact.



### Biomarker List:

*A biomarker is defined as a process, substance, or structure that can be measured in the body or its products in order to analyze the risk to develop a certain disease, to diagnose a disease, to assess disease progress and prognosis, to predict the outcome of various treatment options before their application, or to determine treatment efficacy * - United Nations Environment Programme- Biomarkers in Risk Assessment: Validity and Validation

 - **Physiological**
    - Skin Conductivity: Measures nervous signals sent to different parts of body to indicate amplified arousal. Amplified w/ PTSD, especially when presented with stimulus.
    - Heart Rate and Heart Rate Reactivity: Resting heart rate as well as how the heart rate changes given different stimuli
 - Monoamine (3 emotion neuro-chemicals) (look at Diagnostic Biomarkers for PTSD...Translational)
 - **Neurological (The root cause of PTSD?)**
    - Amygdala activity goes up, size may or may not change
    - Hippocampus size and specific subregions of the hippocampus become smaller
 - Neuroendocrinal
    - HPA: Hypothalmic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis: set of direct influences and feedback interactions among three endocrine glands: pituitary, hypothalamus, adrenal. Namely lower cortisol is a risk factor (varying agreement on this)
    - There are other endocrinal (look at Diagnostic Biomarkers for PTSD...Translational)
 - Immunological- Look at Diagnostic Biomarkers for PTSD...Translational
 - Inflammatory- linked more with diseases that are likely to be comorbid with PTSD (eg depression)
 - Genetic, Transcriptomic, etc.: Found genes directly related to stress, like the *FKBP5* gene, and saw they corresponded with potential development of PTSD. PTSD related genes have been moreso genes related to stress-dependent behavioral disorders.

### Slightly Relevant:

 - [Beyond Fun: The Vital Future of Wearables:](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3042674/the-vital-if-unfun-future-of-wearables) discusses how the future of wearables lies in practical application of them to relevant medical applications. Reasons:
    - Automated health coordination (and automatically shared + standardized collection of data) 
    - Increased access to care (affordability, ease of use)
    - Automated self-exams, remotely activated implants
    - **PTSD:** Wearables allow for remote monitoring, 21% of 5.2 million PTSD Americans receive "minimally adequate treatment."
    - [Neumitra:](https://neumitra.com/research) bio-device that monitors stress via electrodermal signals. Will soon open source data.
