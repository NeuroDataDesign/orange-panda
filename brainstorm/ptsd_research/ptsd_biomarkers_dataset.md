# PTSD Datasets

[CoNNECT Database:](http://www.dartnet.info/CoNNECT.htm) gneralistic data about many PTSD patients. Doesn't really have any of the biomarkers said to look out for, but does look at things like blood pressure, triglycerides... maybe there are some connections? Also, need to pay for data.

[PTSD Multiple Studies Article:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219414/) not an actual study, but looks over several other studies and looks at drawn conclusions from them. Looking through these source studies may find some datasets that can be used.

[UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics LA5c Study:](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000030/)
138 healthy, 58 schizophrenia, 49 bipolar, 45 ADHD patients. Multiple fMRI scans to see variety in phenotype between the states. Not PTSD, but behavioral disorders. Maybe there's gleanable data there somewhere.
