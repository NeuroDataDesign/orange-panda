### Summary:

Analysis of mutliple patients to see if EEG data could be used to detect a subset of emotions. This was in contrast to the set of other variables, such as skin conductance, heart rate, skin temperature, etc. used to make this judgement. The goal was to find a classification technique that could take sample cases and generalize predicting mood in unseen conditions. This subset of emotions was initiated via unique narratives written to evoke these emotions. Relaxation was evoked via relaxation narratives, and was used as a control before the emotion was evoked. All participants claimed they could feel the emotions being evoked. The final predicition would not be which emotion was being evoked, but rather if there was positive or negative valence, and would be based on a quick 6 seconds of EEG data from the subject.

A variety of different types of emotions for both types of valences was used to create test data. It showed high correlation in predictablity. They used CSP to find which frequencies and frequency filters had the highest correlation with valences. Interestingly, while many experiments choose to filter out muscular and ocular movement and activity, many of their filters found correlations and used muscular and ocular movement. Because EMG was contained in their data (due to inherent body reactions to certain emotions, it makes sense EMG was highly relevant), it is unsure if EEG alone can be used to make this prediction. In either case, they did find a way to classify postive or negative valence.

### Scope of BCI:

Again, seemingly very limited in scope of emotional BCI. Slightly reliant on noise as correlated with data. Also only was able to distinguish between positive and negative valence (although very accurately_ 71.3%) and not to more sublevels of emotion. Basically, detection of those disparaties is possible with BCI, but unsure to what extent that can be taken yet. (That does mean there is hope though!) Couldn't find any associated data.
