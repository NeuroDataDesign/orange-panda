  * All sensors must be custom fabricated (from basic chemicals)
  * Requires sweat
  * Not as accurate as blood tests
  * Sweat can be contaminated by  microbes
  * Must be calibated to temperature
  * Electrochemical sensors are very sensitive to temp / skin temp


##Biomarkers
  * sweat composition: glucose / lactate / sodium / potassium / body temperature
  * electrical signals generated upon contact with sweat

##Applications
  * Athletics

  * Converts "brain signals" into sounds of wind
  ⋅⋅*--- Calm mind = calm winds. Vise versa 
  * Traks and displays overall progress
  * 7 hour battery life
  * Sleek
  * 7 total sensors

##Cons
  * Only really used for meditation
  * Only function is to determine to which extend your mind is active


##Biomarkers

  * open API
  * Battery lasts for days
  * Has GPS and heart rate tracking
  * Real time data collection
  * Ex. integrates with lumosity to see how exercise is related to brain training
  
##Cons
  * Heart rate data is highly inaccurate (getting sued over it)
  * Heart rate data is difficult to get from the wrist
  * MEDICAL grade devices (placed around the chest) measure electrical impulses traveling through the heart

##Biomarkers
  * GPS location and accelerometer for distance / steps taken / calories / active minutes
  * Shine a light through the wearer's skin to detect blood activity on the wrist, to measure heart rate
  
##Applications
  * Fitness and lifestyle tracking (exercise / food consumption / sleep patterns)
  * Motivation to exercise through social media integration
  * Being that heart rate data is highly inaccurate, this is mostly just a means of looking at your longterm
    fitness/weight loss /sleep patterns.
