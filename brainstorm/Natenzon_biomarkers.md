#Sweat Sensor

##Pros
  -Real time updates
  -Non-invasive
  -Measure's multiple biomarkers at once

##Cons
  -All sensors must be custom fabricated (from basic chemicals)
  -Requires sweat
  -Not as accurate as blood tests
  -Sweat can be contaminated by  microbes
  -Must be calibated to temperature
  -Electrochemical sensors are very sensitive to temp / skin temp


##Biomarkers
  -sweat composition:
    -glucose / lactate / sodium / potassium / body temperature
  -electrical signals generated upon contact with sweat

##Applications
  -Athletics
