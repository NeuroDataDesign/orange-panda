#[Sweat Sensor](http://www.nature.com/news/wearable-sweat-sensor-paves-way-for-real-time-analysis-of-body-chemistry-1.19254)

##Pros
  * Real time updates
  * Non-invasive
  * Measure's multiple biomarkers at once

##Cons
  * All sensors must be custom fabricated (from basic chemicals)
  * Requires sweat
  * Not as accurate as blood tests
  * Sweat can be contaminated by  microbes
  * Must be calibated to temperature
  * Electrochemical sensors are very sensitive to temp / skin temp


##Biomarkers
  * sweat composition: glucose / lactate / sodium / potassium / body temperature
  * electrical signals generated upon contact with sweat

##Applications
  * Athletics

  * 7 hour battery life
  * Sleek
  * 7 total sensors

##Cons
  * Only really used for meditation
  * Only function is to determine to which extend your mind is active
