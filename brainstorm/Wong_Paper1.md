### Summary:

In this research, the usage of BCI help chronic stroke patients’ with their inability to move their hands via training to operate a mechanical hand orthosis. A magnetoencephalography-based (MEG) BCI control was used by these patients to raise or lower a screen cursor in the direction of a target displayed on the screen. 

Data and Method

	Eight patients had chronic hand plegia as a result of stroke- they had a hand weakness of 0/5. A MEG recording was set up with the device on the patients’ heads with them moving as little as possible. After recording signals from the patients’ brain and decoding them using a u Rhythm-Based BCI which decodes a frequency from the sesorimotor cortex of 9-12 Hz and its harmony of 20-24 Hz. The rhythm can be used to read imagined movements.  Last but not least, a hand orthosis was used to respond to the neural activity. 
	Around 150-250 trials were done per session per patient. The trial showed a target on upper or lower half of the right side of a display. Then a square screen-cursor would move from left to right. The patient needed to control the vertical amplitude so that it will be at the correct x-y coordinate by the time it gets there. 
	The average success rate was 72.48% +/- 18.36% for the last session. The definition of a success is when the cursor arrived at the requested target within a designated time of trial. 6 out of 8 patients have shown significant improvements from the first to the last session. The initial success rate of the first session is 52.84 +/- 20.59%. 

Possibilities

	The usage of MEG as a mean of cursor control is shown to be possible but technology hasn’t been fully perfected yet. The data set can be only be used as an evidence that human training can further improve the incorporation of MEG. If we would like to write a program regarding cursor control, we can go back to this experiment for the market effectiveness of BCI cursor control for reference.
