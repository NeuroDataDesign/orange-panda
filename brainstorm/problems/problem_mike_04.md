### There are many ways to measure one's physical health, but not many to observe one's mental health.
#### Mike Natenzon

## 1. Who does it affect?
Every person.
## 2. Where is it happening?
Globally.
## 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
## 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
People have always been monitoring their physical health, but aside from psychiatry, there doesn't seem to be many ways to evaluate one's
mental health. In recent years mental health issues have been treated with therapy, and the observed effect of prescribed medication. 
This, however, has the core flaw that these practices are  evaluated based on what the patient says, which is not always true (ex. no proof
they took medication).
## 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
BCI offers people the chance to monitor their emotional patterns on their own, day by day (just as many people have a fitness diary). 
Brain signals can be recorded to map emotional states over the course of days, weeks, months, to help people better grasp the long term
patterns of theri emotional states, rather than only focusing on how they feel in the moment, and then forgetting that feeling shortly after.
## 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
There are companies that claim to do this, however, reviews of their products are inconsistent. Their gear is also bulky and not stylish.
There are supported claims that measuring the frequency of emitted brain waves can be used to devermine the users' emotional state.
Wearable fitness tech shows proof of concept that wearable devices can be accepted enough to be worn (and collect data) all throughout
the day.
