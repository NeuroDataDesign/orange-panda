### Substance abuse treatment is difficult to manage and individualize for patients.
#### Nitin Kumar

Description of problem: Tens of millions of US citizens (and people globally) use illicit substances on a near regular basis. Without fail, these drugs alter brain chemistry, and often times result in rewiring of the brain's chemistry so that it's addicted. Breaking from addiction is very difficult, and even more difficult to maintain.

Answer:

1. Who does it affect?
    - Tens of millions of Americans each year, not including fall-out on users' families and careers.

2. Where is it happening?
    - Accross the globe.

3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
    - Substance abuse has been a problem for years, with a variety of substances. However, while it has been treatable, newer technology allows for more optimized and better suited to be treated now. In addition, it is currently relevant because marijuana, alcohol, and other drug use is growing in America and having a bigger hold in both poorer and richer neighborhoods.

4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
    - This problem has been occurring in the real world likely due to societal pressure and increased ease in communication and accessing such drugs. Prescription drugs are likely on the rise for the same reason. Within the brain, the brain associates the release it gets from these drugs with happiness over natural causes (family, activity, etc.) and becomes very attached to the drug.

5. Potential solutions with BCI?
    - In the field of behavioral health, BCI has already made serious breakthroughs in attempts to identify brain imaging biomarkers and neurofeedback treatments (especially for PTSD). Neurofeedback targets treating the actual cause of the issue, the mapping in the brain, and ecouraging signals to stop being dependent on substances. At the same time, not exactly BCI related, but other biomarkers could be used as factors to help individualize one's neurofeedback/treatment (including heart rate, respiratory rate, etc.)

6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
    - Neurofeedback already exists effectively with PTSD, and work is being done in the area currently. In addition, research into brain imaging and other biomarkers already is ongoing.
