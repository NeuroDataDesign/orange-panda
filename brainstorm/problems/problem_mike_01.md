### We waste time and miss out on knowledge because of poor interfacing with computers.
#### Mike Natenzon

## 1. Who does it affect?
Consumers with access to high end electronics (ex. smartphones, tablets, laptops, smartgear)
## 2. Where is it happening?
Globally, in all countries where people have access to electronics.
## 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
Being that people are used to the way computers work now, most would not describe the interface as inconvenient or inefficient.
However, due to the release of virtual and augmented reality headsets, there will be an increase in the demand for BCI. BCI can 
help to make the experience of using these devices even more seamless, allowing us to get closer to full immersion in these digital environments.
## 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
First, people do not realize how inefficient our current means of interacting with computers is,
therefore, there is no big immediate push to develop this technology. Second, until recently, we have been lacking the cost effective technology 
to even produce new means of interfacing with computers. 
## 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
Building in shortcuts to a few very important features. The device affects the targeted features.
## 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
There are a variety of computer controllers working through BCI, however, there is no targeted consumer application. With EEG headsets
becoming increasingly cheaper and more effective, it is possible to build a program for consumer use. We already know it is possible to use
EEG to control various functions of a computer.
