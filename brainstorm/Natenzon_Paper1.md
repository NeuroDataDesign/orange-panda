### Summary:
This thesis explored the functionality of the Emotiv EPOC EEG headset (Released in 2010). The software included has been validated to accurately differentiate 
between facial expressions, emotional states, and imagined cognitive tasks after sufficient training (and after taking into account pre-recorded data). In the
expressive suite, the user receives feedback during training by matching the signal to a simulated face avatar mimicking user's expressions. In the affective suite, the 
EEG headset averages the total value of the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta bands to determine emotional state.

-Expressive suite: claims to recoglize blink, wink, look, raise/furrow brow, smile, clench, smirk, and laugh
-Affective suite: emotional states: engagement/boredom, frustration, meditation, instantaneous excitement, longterm excitement 
-Cognitive suite: push, pull, lift, drop, left, right, rotate(left/right/forward/back/clockwise/counterclockwise, dissapear, passive(neutral) state

The headset was sensitive enough to  collect data to control a robot's movement by cognitive thought, and in creating accurate blink recognition software.

### Scope of BCI:
This research serves indicates that non-invasivek EEG headsets offered by Epoc can be used to accurately recognize a large diversity of inputs. This makes EEG headsets
a feasible technology to be used to control BCI, for PCs, and augmented/virtual reality devices. It can also provide feedback to companies regarding the quality, clarity,
and engagement of advertisements. 
To effectively build the BCI proposed, the system will need to have both synchronus and asynchronous data processing.

Synchronous - user performs a cue, and then EEG pattern is recorded in fixed time. (easier)
Asynchronous - passively overate to continuously monitor the EEG data, trying to classify on the fly.
