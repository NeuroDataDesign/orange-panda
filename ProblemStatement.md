1. Problem Statement
	a. What is the broadly important real-world problem (or class of problems) we are going to solve?
		i. Collecting quantitative data about the emotional states of patients is challenging for psychologists. Isolating causes, issues, and methods of doing so in patients is highly qualitative and based on answering questions and working with the patient to try and isolate how to work through the depression. The data collected is also limited to the information the patient is comfortable discussing. Quantifying someone’s stressors and depression based on signals sent in the brain and neural activity may help figure out what exact issues are bothering the patient and to what extreme, even if the patients are not vocal about these issues. We’re proposing to collect this data throughout a patient’s therapy session to try and find the causes of depression. If feasible, we would then like to extend the EEG emotional state monitoring over the entire course of the day.
		ii. An emotional state is a specific type of neural activity in your brain. Different frequency of EM waves are emitted by the brain, based on their emotional state (ex. happy, anxious, sad)
	b. What will be required to solve that problem?
		i. Data
			1. How patients react emotionally to different topics of conversation. Identifying correlations between emotional states and topics can help psychiatrists gain insight into the topics that must be focused on.
			2. Measurement: Different frequencies in neuron signals have been shown to correlate to different types of emotions. Thus, our data will be identifying which frequencies are emitting the stronger signals, and using it to quantify the emotional state.
				a. Quantification: Methods used in other paper is ratio between beta (12-30 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies to quantify valence (i.e. positive emotions)
			3. Long term: Have EEGs collect emotional data on users throughout the day. Identify trends over time (ex. Most stressful times of day, stress management progress over time, quantitative effects of meditation, etc.)
		ii. Technology
			1. Emotiv Insight, Dry EEG headset
				a. For use in office, no innovation required
				b. For constant daily use, comfortable, small, stylish EEG headsets would need to be developed
		iii. Funding
			1. $600 - Emotiv Insight (Dry) EEG Headset + Raw Data Software
		iv. Societal stuff?
			1. Are people comfortable wearing EEG headsets all day?
			2. Are people comfortable with their emotional states to be recorded?
			3. Are people comfortable with recording their sessions, so that the psychiatrist can tie EEG data trends to conversation topics?
	c. What scientific questions will we answered?
		i. How effective is a particular antidepressant on a specific patient?
			1. Quantitative effects of medication on emotional states?
			2. If antidepressants do cause relapse/have side effects, will adding EEG monitoring make therapy strong enough?
		ii. Quantitative effects of meditation on emotional states?
		iii. Long term effectiveness of current psychiatric practices?
		iv. To what extent is self-help a safe move when dealing with depression?
	d. What deliverable will we provide to the global citizens?
		i. A program that collects EEG data (from a separately purchased headset), analyses it, and sends it to the psychiatrist to find correlations between topics and emotional states.
2. Feasibility
	a. Background
		i. What is the current state of knowledge regarding this problem? 
			1. We can use EEG data to differentiate between emotional states
		ii. What are the key challenges? 
			1. Can we measure different intensities of an emotional state?
			2. How can we collect data for users over the course of the day?
		iii. Has anyone made a concerted effort to solve the problem? Give examples. 
			1. Emotiv has apps on their online store to determine a user’s mood. However, it has no application other than entertainment, and focus training.
		iv. If so, what progress did they make, and why have they not succeeded?
			1. No one has tried this particular application yet, and if they have, it is not widely publicised.
	b. Gap
		i. What gaps in scientific understanding must be bridged in order to solve this problem? 
			1. Can we determine the difference in intensities of different emotional states?
			2. How do we determine what a baseline normal reading is?
		ii. What gaps in technological  capabilities must be bridged in order to solve this problem?
			1. How can we make EEG headsets stylish, small, comfortable, reliable, stable, and dry (electrodes)?
			2. How can we make its battery last all day?
			3. How can we minimize data transfer to decrease user’s exposure to bluetooth frequencies?
		iii. What organizational, financial, and/or technological challenges must be addressed in order to bridge these gaps?
			1. An app, computer program must be created to collect, send, help interpret the EEG data.
			2. Can insurance pay for this?
	c. Work
		i. Why will this approach work? 
			1. Non-invasive / no ingestion of drugs
			2. Relatively cheap ($300-$600 headsets)	
			3. Provides quantitative data that can be analyzed in real-time or after the fact.
		ii. Why might it not, and what can be done to mitigate those challenges? 
			1. Data provides no additional insight over the psychiatrist’s professional experience
		iii. How will you inspire financial support at the end of the year?
			1. Emphasize that it can be an effective means of treating depression, by helping to determine exactly which topic areas should be focused on during counseling sessions.
3. Significance
	a. What tangible benefits would the world derive from solving this problem? For each of the below, provide specific/concrete numbers in absolute terms, and provide a meaningful point of reference (e.g., X costs 10 USD per year, which is Y fraction of medical spending)
		i. Economic
			1. $300 for the analog EEG headset (with 5 channels, the one that we will use for our experiment). The average therapy session right now costs the patient at least $100 per hour. It will be cost effective for clinics to pay for an instrument such as the EEG headset. 
		ii. Medical
			1. Decreased overall levels of depression. Better monitoring of the effectiveness of antidepressants, and common psychiatric practices. Antidepressants cost the US $10 billion dollars per year. We project that it can lower the cost of antidepressants eventually by 5%. Potential for development of new methods to treat depression due to increased access to quantifiable data.
		iii. Scientific
			1. Further connect the “mind” (thinking psyche) with the “brain” (chemical makeup). Also new ways of both quantifying emotion and making the data 
		iv. Societal
			1. NIH funding for suicide prevention is currently 25 million per year, and the total cost to deal with the problem of suicide is 44 million USD. The American suicide rate is 12.93 out of 100000 people per year. Hopefully we can lower this by around 3-5% and around 2-3 million dollars per year. 
	b. Which citizens of the world will be affected?
		i. Those suffering from mental health issues, which is 18.1% of the US population. (We might gear our project towards college students with mental issues, which is approximately 24% of the college student population)
4. Approach
	a. What is the approach for filling these gaps and solving the larger problem?
		i. Scientific Understanding
			1. Extensive trials via EEG allows us to learn what a normal 
			2. EEG checks correlation between emotional intensity and strength in brain signal 
		ii. Technological Gaps
			1. Cost effective more fashionable models do exist. Finding potentially sleeker and more discrete ways of displaying them may still be a challenge.
			2. Solar cells, easily replaceable and transportable batteries (like with Android phones), carryable chargers, etc.
		iii. Organizational, financial gaps
			1. EEG headset that we already have access to has both Bluetooth and phone connection capabilities. Look into designing and external app that collects specific data after the Bluetooth has been paired.
			2. Once becoming an official part of treatment, is more likely to be pushed to be accepted by insurance companies.
	b. What are each of the parts of the approach?
		i. Scientifically
			1. Check the baseline for emotional states, as in mapping normal neural activity. Then we map each emotion one by one in accordance to different conversation topics that triggers certain emotions in a person
			2. To figure out the maximum “safe” emotional distress level, monitor and plot emotional management progress over long periods of time to depict effectiveness of therapy techniques.
		ii. Technologically
			1. Lower EEG manufacture costs (making something in China)
			2. (Later on) - Develop stylish EEG headsets that can be worn throughout the day
		iii. Organizational/Financially
			1. Designing apps as mentioned above
			2. Market it to make this a socially acceptable, relevant treatment for depression
			3. Partner with psychiatrists, so they adapt this method of treatment
			4. Discuss opportunities to have this treatment (or headset) to be covered through insurance
	c. How will each of these disparate parts be coordinated to bridge these gaps and then solve the larger problem? 
		i. Eventually, as the system becomes more effective for treating depression, psychiatrists will ask for access to the program, rather than need convincing. As a result of more widespread use, insurance companies will include this treatment in their health care plans. Ideally, a healthy baseline emotional state trend will be identified and used to compare the emotional states of patients with depression. As people and psychiatrists are quantitatively guided through the treatment progress, people will experience increased motivation after observing their quantitative improvement in dealing with depression.
	d. How is this approach different from the status quo?
		i. Other studies have looked into EEG measurements and how they relate to emotional states. We are looking to use this information to make quantitative patient relevant data more readily available and useable by practitioners. We also plan to add our own analyses to decrease the time practitioners need to commit to processing the data.
	e. How and when will success be measured/quantified?  Be as specific as possible.
		i. We’ll start by seeing if we can accurately isolate causes of stress/depression on a smaller testing scale. After our own sample population is tested, we will also receive feedback from practitioners regarding their opinions on the effectiveness of this method for treating depression.
	f. What does success look like at defined points along the roadmap?
		i. Initially, success will look like simple recognition of emotions and ensuring accurate differentiation of emotions. Moving forwards, it’ll be better if we can isolate actual causes of sadness and depression in either clinic or otherwise stimulating settings. Success can be measured by the quantity of practitioners that are using this means of treating depression, and for the time span that they use it for.
	g. After 10 years, what does moderate success look like? What about huge success?
		i. Moderate success will include the use of this depression treating method among tens or hundreds of practitioners around the world. Huge success will include the wide adaptation of this depression treatment method by thousands of practitioners world-wide, in addition to the adaptation of insurance plans to support this method of treating depression. So long as the user base continues to increase as the time span increases, this project will be deemed a success.
