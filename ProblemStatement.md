1. Problem Statement
   1. What is the broadly important real-world problem (or class of problems) we are going to solve?
      1. Collecting quantitative data about the emotional states of patients is challenging for psychologists.
   1. What will be required to solve that problem?
      1. Data
         1. How intensely patients react to different stimuli,
            1. How this changes over time
      1. Technology
         1. EEG headsets
            1. For use in office, no innovation required
            2. For constant daily use, comfortable, small, stylish EEG headsets would need to be developed
      1. Funding
         1. $600 - Emotiv Insight EEG Headset
      1. Societal stuff?
         1. How can people become comfortable with wearing EEG headsets all day?
   1. What scientific questions will we answered?
      1. How effective are antidepressants?
      2. Long term effectiveness of current psychiatric practices
   1. What deliverable will we provide to the global citizens?
      1. A program that collects EEG data (from a separately purchased headset), analyses it, and sends it to the psychiatrist.
1. Feasibility
   1.  Background
      1. What is the current state of knowledge regarding this problem? 
         1. We can use EEG data to differentiate between emotional states
      1. What are the key challenges? 
         1. Can we measure different intensities of an emotional state?
      1. Has anyone made a concerted effort to solve the problem? Give examples. 
         1. Emotiv has apps on their online store to determine a user’s mood. However, it has no application other than entertainment, and focus training.
      1. If so, what progress did they make, and why have they not succeeded?
         1. No one has tried this particular application yet, and if they have, it is not widely publicised.
   1. Gap
      1. What gaps in scientific understanding must be bridged in order to solve this problem? 
         1. Can we determine the difference in intensities of different emotional states?
         2. How do we determine what a baseline normal reading is?
      1. What gaps in technological  capabilities must be bridged in order to solve this problem? 
         1. How can we make EEG headsets stylish, small, comfortable, reliable, stable, and dry (electrodes)?
         2. How can we make its battery last all day?
      1. What organizational, financial, and/or technological challenges must be addressed in order to bridge these gaps?
         1. An app, computer program must be created to collect, send, help interpret the EEG data.
         2. Can insurance pay for this?
   1. Work
      1. Why will this approach work? 
         1. Non-invasive / no ingestion of drugs
         2. Relatively cheap ($300-$600 headsets)
      1. Why might it not, and what can be done to mitigate those challenges? 
         1. Data provides no added insight (find ways to correlate data to useful observations)
      1. How will you inspire financial support at the end of the year?
         1. Emphasize that it can be an effective means of treating mental health issues.
1. Significance
   1. What tangible benefits would the world derive from solving this problem? For each of the below, provide specific/concrete numbers in absolute terms, and provide a meaningful point of reference (e.g., X costs 10 USD per year, which is Y fraction of medical spending)
      1. Economic
         1. Fewer money spent on antidepressants
      1. Medical
         1. Creation of tiny EEG electrodes.
      1. Scientific
         1. Gives insight into the psyche of the mind
      1. Societal
         1. Fewer mental health related incidents
   1. Which citizens of the world will be affected?
      1. Those suffering from mental health issues.
1.  Approach
   1. What is the approach for filling these gaps and solving the larger problem?
      1. Scientific Understanding
         1. Extensive trials via EEG allows us to learn what a normal 
         2. EEG checks correlation between emotional intensity and strength in brain signal 
      1. Technological Gaps
         1. Cost effective more fashionable models do exist. Finding potentially sleeker and more discrete ways of displaying them may still be a challenge.
         2. Solar cells, easily replaceable and transportable batteries (like with Android phones), carryable chargers, etc.
      1. Organizational, financial gaps
         1. EEG headset that we already have access to has both Bluetooth and phone connection capabilities. Look into designing and external app that collects specific data after the Bluetooth has been paired.
         2. Once becoming an official part of treatment, is more likely to be pushed to be accepted by insurance companies.
   1. What are each of the parts of the approach?


1. Scientifically
        i. A wide sample size, both clinically depressed or considered “normal” and check for baseline for each and see if they’re different
                ii. To figure out the maximum “safe” emotional distress level
                2. Technologically
                        I. Lower manufacture costs (making something in China)
                        Ii. Emerging companies to help with solar technology
                3. Organizational/Financially
                        I. Designing apps as mentioned above
                        Ii. Marketing it to be widely accepted such that insurance companies have to accept it as a treatment
   1. How will each of these disparate parts be coordinated to bridge these gaps and then solve the larger problem? 
        Eventually, these parts will be coordinated to set a floor and a ceiling to ensure human safety in their emotions  and hopefully cause a lower suicide rate
   1. How is this approach different from the status quo?
        Other studies have looked into EEG measurements and how they relate to depression. We are looking to specifically both easily access and harness this information for a casual consumer and make the data readily available and utilizable by practitioners. We also will try to add our own analysis and helping part of the application that will make it stand out as adaptive.
   1. How and when will success be measured/quantified?  Be as specific as possible.
        We are able to help family members prevent suicide and we see that our       patients benefit in emotional health from wearing these medical devices. Quantification or measurement would be in terms of survivability of our patients and periodic psychiatric evaluations.
   1. What does success look like at defined points along the roadmap?
        A certain milestone would be a certain number of people using this gadget. Or actual effect on suicide rate in a small region.
   1. After 10 years, what does moderate success look like? What about huge success?
                Moderate success would be a slight drop in suicide rate and a huge success would be an item that’s not uncommon to see for the household along with a great drop in suicide rates.
