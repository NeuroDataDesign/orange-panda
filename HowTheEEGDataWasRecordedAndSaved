Data records
For each subject an individual folder was created. Each folder the EEG contains the EEG simply
binary files (XXX.raw) for each paradigm individually. There are two eye-tracker files for each
paradigm: one file is segmented into blinks, saccades and fixations (xxx_Events.txt). The other
file is an unsegmented file, with the eye-tracking information for each sample. Furthermore, each
folder contains for each paradigm a MATLAB file (XXX.mat), which includes the information
about the examination date and the paradigm itself (e.g. inter-trial interval, triggers, number of
trials, response selection and reaction time (if available), For users, which intend to use the data
without MATLAB, the information are also available as .csv files.
