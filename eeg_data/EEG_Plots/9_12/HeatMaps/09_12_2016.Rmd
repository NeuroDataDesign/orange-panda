
This week. I plotted Heat Maps for EEG Data for the six paradigms. Each graph has around 30 electrodes as the x-axis and the time steps as y-axis. 

This melts the data into three columns, one is the time steps, another the electrode name, and the last is the voltage.

```
eegmelt <- function(eegdata) {
  library(ggplot2)
  library(reshape2)
  eegdata.m <- melt(eegdata)
  library(plyr)
  eegdata.m <- ddply(eegdata.m, .(variable), transform)
  return(eegdata.m)
}
```

Plots the heat map of voltage vs time across electrodes. Reuiqres input of the melted data frame from melteegdata
```
voltageheatmap <- function(eegsubsetting1min15electrodes) {
library(ggplot2)
g <-  ggplot(eegsubsetting1min15electrodes, aes(variable,Time)) +
      geom_tile(aes(fill = value), color = "white") + 
      #The color blue was arbitrary
      scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red3") +
      labs(x="Electrode Names",y="Time (ms)") +
      ggtitle("Voltage of Electrodes of Video Trial for Patient A00051826")
  
print(g)
}
```

I used this to graph the first 6 seconds of every paradigm and have around 30 electrodes per graph.
