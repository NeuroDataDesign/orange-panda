# Hypotheses

**Intrasubject Hypothesis**

(Main focus for Initial Exploratory Analylsis) For resting state, the saccade duration might increase as time elapsed increases, especially for anxiety and ADHD patients. Therefore, this might result in:  
		i. The lack of ability to focus in other experiments (such as contrast change and sequence learning) and leads to less accuracy.  
		ii. Increased SSVEP/ more varied SSVEP in the surround suppression experiment.

**Intersubject Hypothesis**

ADHD and anxiety disease will cause the subjects to more eye movements and have less focused brain activity over time in all paradigms, and will have similar trends.
