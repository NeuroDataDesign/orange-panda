## Read EEG Data

Here is the overhead wrapper EEG function. Using the access keys provided in 
system environment variables, it runs and grabs eeg data based on patient
number, whether you want full or reduced data, and which paradigm you want data
about (1 = Resting, etc. We have more documentation on which is which in excel).

```{r}
getwd();
#sys.frame(1)$ofile;
#parent.frame(2)$ofile
source('read_data.R');
eegdata <- readeeg(patientnum = "A00051826", record = 1, recordtype = "full");
head(eegdata)
```

## Read Eyetracking Event Data

Eyetracking event data is also now grabbable with similar vars.

```{r}
eventdata <- readevent(patientnum = "A00051826", record = "Rest", recordtype = "full");
sapply(eventdata, head)
```
