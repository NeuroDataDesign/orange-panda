## Joint Probability Distributions:

- X, Y are random vars
- X e S and Y e T
- (X, Y) e S x T
- Distribution of (X, Y) is joint distribution
- X, Y have marginal distributions
- When dependent, not simple conversion

Joint and Marginal Densities
- When **independent,** joint density is product of marginal densities
- Otherwise... well figure it out
