# Data Sharing Paper Notes
## Ryan Marren, Sept 10 2016

### Summary
These notes detail possible correlations between data and the presence of psychological disorders.
In general, there were many possible indicators of ADHD and a few for other disorders. 

### Comments 
This list focuses on types of evidence given a certain disorder, but of interest also may be disorders given a certain type of evidence. One good example of this is that SSVEP levels correlate (positively or negatively) with the presence of many different disorders like schizophrenia, depression, autism, and migranes. It may be interesting future work to search for more domain-general measurements of psychological disorders.

### ADHD
* [Willcutt et al. 2005](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/logopedie/files/9214/1285/1096/article-mayor-dubois.pdf) is a meta analysis on 83 ADHD studies with 3724 subjects with and 2969 subjects without ADHD. Measures of response inhibition, vigilance, working memory, and planning all correlated strongly with the presense of ADHD. Perhaps these measures can be extracted from the various tasks in our data (e.g. the symbol search, sequence learning, and contrast change)
* In the naturalistic viewing task, two math-related videos were shown to test attention issues. Perhaps levels of brain activity (to tell how much they are focusing and processing) and eye movements (whether they are following salient parts of the video) can give us a measure of attention levels.
* Reaction times in the Contrast Change paradigm could give a measure of the subjects processing speed
* The rate of decrease of the subjects P300 component during the Sequence Learning Paradigm could indicate how actively they are processing and attending to the task.
* The paper claims that the theta / (beta 1 + 2) ratio of the resting EEG is used in ADHD research, but does not offer a citation or further explaination.

###Schizophrenia
* The SSVEP measurement from the surround supression paradigm can tell us whether a subject is suffering from certain defecits in visual processing which are common in patients with schizophrenia (citation)[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248396388_Altered_Contextual_Modulation_Of_Primary_Visual_Cortex_Responses_in_Schizophrenia]

###Autism
* The SSVEP measurement from the surround supression paradigm can also tell us whether vision enhancements which are commonly found in subjects with autism are present [citation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726259/)

###Anxiety
* The naturalistic viewing paradigm contains videos which can probe for environment related anxiety (e.g. school related, social anxiety)

###Depression
* People with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) often have improved performance on tasks such as the contrast change task. Therefore, the SSVEP measurement could possibly be used as a predictor of MDD. [citation](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/28/9072.short)
