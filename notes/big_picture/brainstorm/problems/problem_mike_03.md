### We are not learning/teaching information as efficiently as possible
#### Mike Natenzon

## 1. Who does it affect?
Literallly everyone in the world, of all ages, who has access to high end electronics.
## 2. Where is it happening?
Globally, in all countries where people have access to electronics.
## 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
People have been teaching others as best we could using the technologies available to us. More recently, development in augmented/virtual
reality has created opportunities for new forms of education. Since these new technologies are just recently becoming widely available,
there are few companies offering virtual education.
## 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
People need to find accelerated ways of gaining information, because of the increasing amount of information that we must remember and
recall.
## 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
Using low frequency electrical currents for non invasive brain stimulation (known to accelerate learning of complex tasks).
Integrating VR/AR with BCI neurofeedback/stimulation for an educational experience that is better taylored to the student's needs.
## 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
HRL Laboratories received a 2 year grant from DARPA and BTO to continue developing a system that stimulates the brain to accelerate learning.
They use an EEG can with high-definition transcranial current stimulation to stimulate certain regions of the users brain while a user
learns a new task. WHen tested with pilots and users just learning to fly a plane, those that received this stimulation learned faster
than those who did not.
