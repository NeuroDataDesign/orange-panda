### Suggestive music algorithms just dont work.
#### Mike Natenzon

## 1. Who does it affect?
Everyone using music services that recommend songs the user "will like"
## 2. Where is it happening?
Globally.
## 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
Companies such as soundcloud, pandora, apple music, and spotify have only recently been using machine learning algorithms to learn
the listening patterns of users to better recommend music. Due to this recent innovation, the problem is only just arising:
companies are still nto great at recommending the right music at the right time.
## 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
Whe you hear a song using one of the aformentioed services, you can usually rate it as good, bad, or unrated. Companies use these inputs
to form an idea of your listening patterns. However, these recommendations do not account for the mood I am in on any particular day. So
one day I may upvote a sad song, and another day I wont.
## 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
Use BCI to provide feedback to companies on your current emotional state, and on your emotional state while you listened to / rated a 
particular song. That way, companies can make recommendations of songs to you based on how you are feeling, and on the songs you liked to 
listen to the last time you were feeling this way.
## 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
We know that we can extract emotional state data using an EEG headset, however, it does not appear to have been used on a wide scale
for the application mentioned above.
