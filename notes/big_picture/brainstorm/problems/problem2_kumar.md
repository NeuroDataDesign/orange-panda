### PTSD lacks popularized effective individualized and manageable treatment. While already seeing some incorporation of BCI, additional newer technology may see serious advancement for patients.
#### Nitin Kumar

Description of problem: PTSD is a disease with many treatment routes, all dependent on the skill of the therapist, openness of the patient, and the fit of the treatment with the patient. While [current common treatments should be effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842024), they still have a chance of both inefficacy and are aimed at treating symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem. [These solutions thus are not perfect.](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/health-care/2015/08/19/efficacy-ptsd-treatments-questioned/31195621/) [Further evidence accross the web supports this.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/18/AR2007101802186.html)

Answer:

#### 1. Who does it affect?
War veterans, refugees (even refugee children!), shooting survivors, etc. With the current mass shooting and terrorist climate, PTSD is more prevalent than ever.

#### 2. Where is it happening?
Accross the globe, traumatic events occur all the time, especially in this day and age.

#### 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
As stated in question 1, this issue affects veterans, and currently refugees and survivors of mass shootings. The worst part of it is, refugee children likely do not have access to treatments they need, and their brains will be permanently scarred for dangerous behavioral diseases later on. Despite always being a problem, this issue is incredibly prevalent now.

#### 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
PTSD is triggered by a traumatic event (usually near-death), that causes someone's brain to reshape, causing hyperactivity, hiding of memories, etc. In worse cases, they may even lose ability to tell the difference between reality and their memories/imagination when approaching a trigger related to an event previously in their life. Within the brain, this occurs due to altering a [section of the brain (typically the hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, or nearby areas).](http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/24/how-does-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-change-the-brain/)

#### 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
Solutions are endless. Neurofeedback to increase resistance to changed chemistry, monitoring of simulated reenactments of traumatic events, monitoring to see emotive triggers, using brain imaging to see which specific parts of the brain are affected and thus how to interact with the patient best to treat them, etc. Also, other monitored biomarkers could help personalize the neurofeedback and the situation.

#### 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
[Neurofeedback treatment is already prevalent.](https://neurodevelopmentcenter.com/psychological-disorders/ptsd/neurofeedback-for-ptsd/) Virtual reality hasn't progressed to the point it's practical to be used here, but the idea has been slightly explored. There has been a surge in available biomarkers as well.
