### We are constantly bombarded with advertisements that we don't care for.
#### Mike Natenzon

## 1. Who does it affect?
Everyone who uses the internet
## 2. Where is it happening?
Globally
## 3. What is the timeline of the problem (Did it just become more relevant? Has it been ongoing but previously untreatable? Is it a coming problem that we could work towards now?)? What makes this currently relevant?
Since the internet was adopted by the general public, corporations have found ways to make money from it. One major way of doing this
is through internet advertisements. Now, and even moreso in the future, people will need to find effective ways of still seeing 
advertisements, but making them more greated to our actual goals and interests.
## 4. Why is this problem happening? What is the main cause (both within brain and outside it?)?
Corporations see advertising to you as a means of making money.
## 5. Potential solutions with BCI?
By providing corporations feedback regarding how their product / advertisement / etc. made the user feel, corporations will be more
suited to fix their products / advertising tactics to better fit the user. This will in turn result in a happier user experience, causing
users to associate good memories with an advertisement/company, rather than bad ones.
## 6. Is there existing work/data with BCI?
There are some EEG headsets that claim to be able to differentiate between 6 different emotional states, however, it is unclear how
effective they are at doing this. It is clear though, that we can differentiate between a positive and negative emotional state in the 
majority of instances
